Figure out an approach to fuzz Marshal/Unmarshal.

finish implementing Conn for incoming calls and signals

skip struct padding for structs that are entirely vardict
encoded. Currently can't write a struct that is a pure vardict and use
it where dbus wants a dict, it'll get padded wrong.

support encoding maps as either a{xy} or a(xy). Various dbus protocols
use the latter for some reason.

implement peer identity stuff in terms of GetCredentials and the pidfd
under the hood, when pidfd passing is available, rather than just
expose the random bag of deprecated and unsafe APIs DBus offers.

maybe allow unmarshaling a property into a *any, so people can get
properties of unknown type and then reflect on the output.

matcher logic needs to handle pointers properly, throughout. I'm not
giving it any thought in the first pass while I nail down the API
shape.

Update marshaler/unmarhsaler docstrings to remove mention of
Marshal/Unmarshal, since those are no longer exported.

Export fragment mapper funcs for people doing custom encoding stuff.

Get rid of the internal marshal/unmarshal funcs. Their callers
can/should just use fragments.Encoder/Decoder directly.

thread safety of transport. Currently message transmit/receive isn't
atomic.
