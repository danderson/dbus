More, better error types. Currently we return ErrUnrepresentable for
most things, even when the problem isn't representability.

Implement FileDescriptor properly, with stashing/unstashing of file
descriptors in encoder/decoder state.

Figure out an approach to fuzz Marshal/Unmarshal.

Break up Marshaler/Unmarshaler interfaces a bit more. Signature is
only needed when encoding/decoding to a Variant or a message
body. AlignDBus is only necessary if the value ends up in an empty
array, for the weird start padding on zero-length arrays thing. Many
values could implement just MarshalDBus/UnmarshalDBus and live happily
ever after.

Better handling of nil embedded structs in marshal, I think right now
it'll just panic.

Combine struct and vardict into one uber-struct-and-vardict type.
Makes header work better, probably better ergonomics elsewhere too
for types that are trying to be "extensible structs".

finish implementing Conn for incoming calls and signals
