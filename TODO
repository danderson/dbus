Figure out an approach to fuzz Marshal/Unmarshal.

Break up Marshaler/Unmarshaler interfaces a bit more. Signature is
only needed when encoding/decoding to a Variant or a message
body. AlignDBus is only necessary if the value ends up in an empty
array, for the weird start padding on zero-length arrays thing. Many
values could implement just MarshalDBus/UnmarshalDBus and live happily
ever after.

finish implementing Conn for incoming calls and signals

skip struct padding for structs that are entirely vardict
encoded. Currently can't write a struct that is a pure vardict and use
it where dbus wants a dict, it'll get padded wrong.

support encoding maps as either a{xy} or a(xy). Various dbus protocols
use the latter for some reason.
