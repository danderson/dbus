Figure out an approach to fuzz Marshal/Unmarshal.

skip struct padding for structs that are entirely vardict
encoded. Currently can't write a struct that is a pure vardict and use
it where dbus wants a dict, it'll get padded wrong.

support encoding maps as either a{xy} or a(xy). Various dbus protocols
use the latter for some reason.

maybe allow unmarshaling a property into a *any, so people can get
properties of unknown type and then reflect on the output.

Export fragment mapper funcs for people doing custom encoding stuff.
