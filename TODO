More, better error types. Currently we return ErrUnrepresentable for
most things, even when the problem isn't representability.

Decode variant types. Requires implementing some kind of DynamicStruct
or RawStruct helper type.

Implement the dbus.Message type.

Implement FileDescriptor properly, with stashing/unstashing of file
descriptors in encoder/decoder state.

Implement the transport and actually talk to dbus.

Figure out clean representations for map[K]dbus.Variant, so that user
code doesn't have to type assert all over the place for maps that have
a known key->signature(value) mapping (like the dbus.Message optional
headers).

Figure out an approach to fuzz Marshal/Unmarshal.
